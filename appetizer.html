                    <p>The taco's core ingredients generally consist of: a tortilla or shell and meat or fish 
                        filling. Vegetables, sauces, cheese salsa and guacamole are also frequently part of 
                        the mix.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tacos taste best when they're made with a variety of fresh, simple ingredients. You don't 
                        need to get too fancy - the beauty of the taco is it's the sum of its parts. You can 
                        cut down on prep time by buying some bits and making your fillings in advance - you can 
                        make pulled pork in a slow cooker, for example, and freeze any extra to use later on. 
                        Part of what makes a taco so appealing is how easily it can be pulled together - and 
                        if you're serving family and friends you can create variety with a few different 
                        fillings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tacos can be enjoyed as a snack or a main dish, and you can complement your efforts by 
                        adding a few tasty side dishes into the mix. Nachos are a quick and easy side dish and 
                        can often be made using many of the same ingredients you used to prepare your tacos. 
                        Refried beans are a delicious addition to any Mexican dish, and you can make them in 
                        a snap when you keep a can of our Old El Pasoâ„¢ refried beans to hand.</p>

                    <p>Smoked salmon is a preparation of salmon, typically a fillet that has been cured and 
                        hot or cold smoked. Due to its moderately high price, smoked salmon is considered a 
                        delicacy. Although the term lox is sometimes applied to smoked salmon, they are 
                        different products.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Smoking is used to preserve salmon against microorganism spoilage. During the process 
                        of smoking salmon the fish is cured and partially dehydrated, which impedes the 
                        activity of bacteria. An important example of this is Clostridium botulinum, which can 
                        be present in seafood, and which is killed by the high heat treatment which occurs 
                        during the smoking process. Smoked salmon has featured in many Native American 
                        cultures for a long time[citation needed]. Smoked salmon was also a common dish in 
                        Greek and Roman culture throughout history, often being eaten at large gatherings and 
                        celebrations. During the Middle Ages, smoked salmon became part of people's diet 
                        and was consumed in soups and salads. The first smoking factory was from Poland in 
                        the 7th century A.D. The 19th century marked the rise of the American smoked salmon 
                        industry in the West Coast, processing Pacific salmon from Alaska and Oregon.</p>

                    <p>No doubt about it, this is a shrimp salad you'll want to eat all summer long. Chilled 
                        shrimp are tossed with crisp celery and red onion, then coated in a creamy, bright, 
                        and herb-y dressing that'll keep the requests for seconds coming.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A nostalgic dish from the 80s, shrimp salad is a perfectly classic summer dish that's a 
                        consistent favorite. Our version is anything but old school. We gave the classic salad 
                        an upgrade with red onion, celery, fresh dill, and a lighter mayo dressing 
                        (no gloopiness here) with Dijon and lemon zest for zing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our mayo-based dressing masters the balance between being creamy without being gloopy. 
                        We brighten things up by including the juice and zest of a lemon, and add a bit of 
                        complexity with some dijon mustard. The result is a light, refreshing dressing that 
                        ties our whole salad together without overpowering it. Plain-boiled potatoes could 
                        also serve as a base for the shrimp salad.</p>

                    <p>
                        Highly sought after for their sweet flavour and giant meaty claws, the meat from the 
                        king crab can be eaten hot or cold, and is delicious in a variety of dishes like 
                        simple sandwiches and salads to crab cakes and linguine. King crab is sold in clusters 
                        of long, thick legs, which are then cracked open. The key is to ensure you have nice, 
                        intact, presentable pieces of meat like in Dave Watts' glorious recipe for King crab 
                        with leeks and sea vegetable salad. The fleshy king crab meat pairs well with a 
                        variety of flavours and seasoning as is reflected in our versatile collection of 
                        recipes. Also, king crab meat can be steamed, boiled, grilled and baked and pairs well 
                        with other seafood too, such as in Matthew Tomkinson's delicious, nutrient packed 
                        recipe for Alaska salmon with braised lettuce and king crab.</p>
