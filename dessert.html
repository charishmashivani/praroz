                    <p>Red velvet cake got its name in the 1800s, when bakers added cocoa to cakes to make 
                        them taste and feel luxurious. The cocoa gave the cakes a velvety texture and feel. 
                        When bakers added vinegar, baking soda, or buttermilk to their recipes to tenderize 
                        the cakes, the acid in those ingredients reacted with the cocoa, which was not 
                        Dutch-processed, to give the cakes a red tint. That color became a signature of velvet
                        cakes. During World War II, ingredient rationing led some bakers and cooks to use beet 
                        juice to mimic that effect, and the color became more prominent. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Today, red velvet cake is made by combining cocoa powder, butter, sugar, eggs, and 
                        flour as well as buttermilk, vinegar, and red food coloring that gives the cake its 
                        iconic red tint. In a classic red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting is paired but the 
                        cake can be really be frosted with anything. Although red velvet does contain a bit of 
                        cocoa powder in it, it is not considered to be a chocolate cake in the same way a 
                        German or Belgian cake would be.

                    <p>Strawberry cake is a cake that uses strawberry as a primary ingredient. Strawberries 
                        may be used in the cake batter, atop the cake, and in the frosting. Strawberry cakes 
                        are typically served cold.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Strawberry cakes may be prepared with strawberries in the batter, with strawberries 
                        atop them, with strawberries or a strawberry filling in between the layers of a layer 
                        cake, and in any combination thereof. Some are prepared with strawberries incorporated 
                        into a frosting. Fresh or frozen strawberries may be used. Some may utilize 
                        strawberry-flavored gelatin as an ingredient, which can give the cake a pink color 
                        when it is mixed in with the batter. A garnish of strawberries is used on some 
                        strawberry cakes. Strawberry cake may be prepared as a gluten-free dish.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some versions are served chilled, and some are frozen and then served in a partially 
                        frozen state. Ricotta cheese is sometimes used as an ingredient in the cake batter or 
                        as a topping. Strawberry cake is sometimes prepared using a prepared cake mix as a base, 
                        such as a white cake mix, upon which additional ingredients are added to the batter or atop 
                        the cake. It is sometimes prepared and served as a dish on Valentine's Day.</p>

                    <p>Potluck parties are a fun opportunity to get together with family and friends—and a 
                        chance for everyone to share a dish they love. Whether you're hosting a dessert 
                        potluck or have been asked to bring something sweet, our potluck desserts collection 
                        will provide plenty of inspiration. Importantly, these crowd-friendly desserts, like 
                        cupcakes, cookies, and sheet cakes, also travel well.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We favor desserts that can be portioned ahead of time, such as bar cookies or Bundt 
                        cakes, so there is less to fuss over at the last minute. With that said, we have 
                        included a few treats, like fruit crisps, that you would scoop and serve at the party. 
                        Regardless, most of our recipes are easy to make—and will surely be the star of the 
                        potluck's dessert table.</p>

                    <p>Oreos and cheesecake wrapped into one dessert? What's not to love? So. Many. Oreos. 
                        If you are an Oreo fan like me, you will not be disappointed. 
                        From the crust to the filling to the decorations, this cheesecake is absolutely 
                        bursting with Oreos.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Great texture. I love the smooth, creamy cheesecake filling. The Oreos add some texture, 
                        but soften while the cheesecake bakes. 
                        Easy to make it your own. There is a lot of room to play with this recipe. Try using a 
                        different flavor of Oreo, a flavored whipped cream such as my Baileys Chocolate Whipped 
                        Cream, or consider using Chocolate Ganache instead of white chocolate ganache.</p>

                    <p>Mango Cake is a type of cake made with mango infuused chiffon cake, iced with a mild 
                        whipped cream cheese frosting topped with pureed mangoes</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This mango cake for our post today uses a chiffon base, infused with mango then layered 
                        and coated in light cream cheese whipped cream frosting drizzled with pureed mangoes. 
                        It's quite straightforward like any chiffon cakes, the only thing hard with it is to 
                        give it a really nice mango taste so it does not taste like a normal vanilla cake, 
                        without using a flavouring I achieved that by reducing pureed mangoes to a thick 
                        consistency and used that on our base. We also used fresh mangoes and sandwiched it in 
                        between the layers of the cake. And to make it light, the icing is made with whipped 
                        cream infused with a little bit of cream cheese and topped with mango puree.</p>

                    <p>French chef Michel Bras said that he invented the cake in 1981, after two years of 
                        experimentation, with his original inspiration being a family group warming themselves 
                        up after a skiing trip by drinking hot chocolate. French chef and chocolatier Jacques 
                        Torres confirms that such a dessert existed in France in the 1980s. French chef 
                        Jean-Georges Vongerichten, for his part, said that he invented the dish in New York City 
                        in 1987. He recalled pulling a chocolate sponge cake from the oven before it was done 
                        and finding that the center was still runny, but warm with both a good taste and 
                        texture. He has been credited with popularizing the molten chocolate cake in the 
                        United States, where it became an almost de rigueur inclusion on high-end restaurant 
                        dessert menus in the 1990s.</p>
